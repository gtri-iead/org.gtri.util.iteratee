   * An interface for an immutable state of a Mealy machine. Applying a buffer 
   * of input to the Machine returns an immutable result object that contains 
   * the next immutable Machine state, the output, any overflow (unused input) 
   * and any issues raised during processing. A Machine signals completion (or 
   * the presence of errors) by way of the status method. Further calls to the 
   * apply method after a Machine's status method has indicated completion are a 
   * noop and will result in all applied input being returned as overflow in the 
   * result. Once all input has been applied to a Machine, the endOfInput method 
   * must be called to signal to the Machine to move to a completion state 
   * (either SUCCESS or FATAL_ERROR).
   * 
   * Note1: Machine.State implementations should not throw exceptions. Instead,
   * exceptions should be returned as issues in the result and the 
   * status of the next Machine set to FATAL_ERROR (should processing stop) or 
   * RECOVERABLE_ERROR (if processing may continue).
   * 
   * Note2: Application of input to a Machine may result in more overflow than 
   * input applied in the method call. Earlier Machine.States may internally 
   * cache input that is then returned by a later Machine state.
