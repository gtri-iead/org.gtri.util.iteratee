/**
 * An interface that represents the immutable state of some enumerator. The 
 * state of the enumerator (an Enumeratee) is stepped forward by calling the 
 * step method. The step method returns some enumerated output, any issues 
 * encountered during processing and a new Enumeratee that may be advanced 
 * further. An Enumeratee signals completion (or the presence of errors) by way 
 * of the status method. Further calls to the step method after an Enumeratee's
 * status method has indicated completion are a noop.
 * 
 * Note1: Enumeratee implementations should not throw exceptions. Instead,
 * exceptions should be returned as issues in the result and the 
 * status of the next Enumeratee set to FATAL_ERROR (should processing stop) or 
 * RECOVERABLE_ERROR (if processing may continue).
