/**
 * An interface that represents the immutable state of a translator that can
 * translate a buffer of input items into a buffer of output items. The apply
 * method can be used to translate a buffer of input items into an immutable 
 * result object that contains a buffer of output items, a list of issues that
 * occurred during processing and the next Translatee.
 * 
 * Note1: Translatee implementations should not throw exceptions. Instead,
 * exceptions should be returned as issues in the result and the 
 * status of the next Translatee set to FATAL_ERROR (should processing stop) or 
 * RECOVERABLE_ERROR (if processing may continue).

 * @author Lance
 * @param <A> the input type
