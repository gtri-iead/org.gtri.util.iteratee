  /**
   * An interface for an immutable state of an Iteratee. Applying a buffer 
   * of input to the Iteratee returns an immutable result object that contains 
   * the next immutable Iteratee state, the output, any overflow (unused input) 
   * and any issues raised during processing. An Iteratee signals completion (or 
   * the presence of errors) by way of its status method. Further calls to the 
   * apply method after an Iteratee's status method has indicated completion are 
   * a noop and will result in all applied input being returned as overflow in 
   * the result. Once all input has been applied to an Iteratee, the endOfInput 
   * method must be called to signal to the Iteratee to move to the SUCCESS or 
   * FATAL_ERROR status.
   * 
   * Note1: Iteratee.State implementations should not throw exceptions. Instead,
   * exceptions should be returned as issues in the result and the 
   * status of the next Iteratee set to FATAL_ERROR should processing be stopped
   * or RECOVERABLE_ERROR if processing may continue.
   * 
   * Note2: Application of input to an Iteratee may result in more overflow than 
   * input applied in the method call. Earlier Iteratee.States may internally 
   * cache input that is then returned by a later Iteratee state.
