/**
 * An interface that represents the immutable state of a loop. An Iteratee is 
 * advanced to the next state by calling the apply method with a buffer of 
 * input. The apply method returns an immutable result object that contains a 
 * list of issues that occurred during processing, any input that was not used 
 * by the Iteratee and the next immutable Iteratee. The Iteratee's state method 
 * may be called to retrieve the state of the loop after each application of 
 * input. An Iteratee signals completion (or the presence of errors) by way of 
 * the status method. Further calls to the apply method after an Iteratee's 
 * status method has indicated completion are a noop and will result in all 
 * applied input being returned as overflow in the result. Additionally, once 
 * all input has been applied to an Iteratee, the endOfInput method should be 
 * called to signal to the Iteratee to move to a completion status (either 
 * SUCCESS or FATAL_ERROR).
 * 
 * Note1: Iteratee implementations should not throw exceptions. Instead,
 * exceptions should be returned as issues in the result and the 
 * status of the next Iteratee set to FATAL_ERROR (should processing stop) or 
 * RECOVERABLE_ERROR (if processing may continue).
